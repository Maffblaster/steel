At the moment there's no binary packages available for Steel, so you will need 
to compile Steel from the source code. It's easy and fast. Steel depends on SQLite, 
Mhash and Libmcrypt. Of course also GCC and GNU Make are required.

To install the dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04:

      sudo apt-get install libmhash-dev libmcrypt-dev libsqlite3-dev
    
To install the dependencies on Archlinux:

      sudo pacman -S libmcrypt mhash sqlite
    
To download the source code of Steel, you have two choices. Either get the 
latest code from Gitlab or download the latest stable version of Steel. 
It's recommend to get the stable version, as the development version might have 
bugs and it might have not been tested very well.

To install Steel move to Steel source code directory and type following commands:

      make
      sudo make install
    
Steel will be installed on /usr/local/bin/ by default. Man page will be installed 
to /usr/local/share/man/man1/.
